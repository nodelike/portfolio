<a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~gamvrosi/thelastq.html" target="_blank">The last question</a> keeps me up at night. If death is fundamental, why are we here?

Life seems to exist because universe seems to be maximising entropy through free energy dissipation.

The most prevalent philosophy of life of modern age is existentialism. Existentialism is simply put: Life is fundamentally meaningless but as an individual human being, you create your own meaning in this universe. Even though I disagree that life is not fundamentally meaningless, I think there is a bigger game that is being played in this universe, but nonetheless, existentialism is the current best we got for modern age theological beliefs.

I recently watched DUNE part two. When I was watching the movie, I was completely immeresed in the universe of DUNE. That movie gave me a new experience that opened my mind to new universes. I would like to have new experiences like that. I want to see what it would really like if were to face an alien civilization like in the 3 Body Problem series.

In denial of death, I want power over nature.
In search for truth, I want infinite experiences.

I believe there is an civilization out there in the past, present or the future which will outlast time through VR and increases the render rate of the subjective experience.


I think the ultimate game is to actualize the mind of the god. Or in Schopenhauer's terms, reinforce the Will of the nature. Even the god is dying. God wants to [outlast the universe](https://youtu.be/5UxUS6bPiT8).
