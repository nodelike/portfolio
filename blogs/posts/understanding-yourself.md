# I experience, therefore I am

Last night I was [watching a session](https://www.youtube.com/live/430UIt6mLW4) of Dr.K (aka, Dr. Alok Kanojia, US licensed American psychiatrist) with a game developer Thor. There is a lot to unpack there. I slept thinking about the main cognitive structure that was explained by Dr.K. And even when I woke up and was like half awake and wasn't totally conscious, I was just thinking about these: perception, emotions, intelligence, memory, attention, ego. And as soon as I woke up completely, I started thinking about the mundane stuff, I need to checkout rooms that are available to shift to Bangalore, need to get cheque from car insurance company, and so on. Since I was thinking about even when I half awake, I figured I need to write this down. 

I might have to rewatch the video for more concrete understaning, but this is what I've gathered so far.

These are the fundamental blocks of information processing of the brain:
1. Perception
2. Emotion
3. Intelligence
4. Memory
5. Attention
6. Ego



**Perception:** Perception is how your brain views the sensory data, not the sensory data itself. So a person suffering from [HPPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3736944/) (Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder), will see noisy stuff floating around in your vision, not because the noise exists in the objective reality but because your brain perceives it as noise due to disorder. Perception is not the reality. Subjective truths starts from perception. Perception is the story your brain makes of off sensory data. 

**Emotion:**

**Intelligence:** Then comes this intelligemce or analytical reaction.

**Memory:** Memory is bit weird. Memory is always accessed in all the mental processes that happen. Like for example, when you perceive something, even perception comes from the grounds of memory.
