<a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~gamvrosi/thelastq.html" target="_blank">The last question</a> keeps me up at night. If death is fundamental, why are we here?

Life seems to exist because universe seems to be maximising entropy through free energy dissipation.
Assembly theory also seems suggest that universe is incresing the global net information density and entropy by increasing the local complexities through evolution and selection of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object" target="_blank">objects</a> in the universe. Ironcially the very thing that enables life to exist is also the killer of the life. Entropy. In order to perform useful work, or to create order, you're always creating more disorder somewhere else. There will a come a point in the universe when there is no more useful energy to do work and the universe reaches thermodynamic equilibrium. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe" target="_blank">The end of times</a>.

This document is heavily inspired from <a href="https://youtu.be/5UxUS6bPiT8" target="_blank">Outlasting the universe</a> by David Klipping. In this document we discuss how living in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_world" target="_blank">metaverse</a> might really be the only way to outlast the heat death of the universe and live a meaningfull life.

The most prevalent philosophy of modern age is existentialism. Existentialism is simply put: Life is fundamentally meaningless but as an individual human being, you create your own meaning in this universe. Even though I disagree that life is not fundamentally meaningless, I think there is a bigger game that is being played in this universe, but nonetheless, existentialism is the current best we got for modern age theological beliefs.

Considering death as fundamental and an important priori in our understanding of the universe, it really comes down to the question what is "your" meaning of life? What is "your" purpose in the universe?

I have always loved art. Especially the art of storytelling. I have <a href="https://tvtime.com/r/30nXp" target="_blank">watched a lot</a> of TV Shows, Anime and Movies. One of the reasons I think storytelling captivates the human mind besides music is because of the nature of complexities invloved in wrtiting a captivating story that mirrors the real world. Whenever I'm engaged in a storytelling artform, I am completely immersed in those worlds with the characters and the plot. I have <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bu1cFIBnQjF/" target="_blank">learned with them, fought with them, loved with them, cried with them, laughed with them, grieved with them.</a>

I recently watched DUNE part two. When I was watching the movie, I was completely immeresed in the universe of DUNE. That movie gave me a new experience that opened my mind to new universes. I would like to have new experiences like that. I want to see what it would really like if were to face an alien civilization like in the 3 Body Problem series.

In denial of death, I want power over nature.
In search for truth, I want infinite experiences.

I believe there is an civilization out there in the past, present or the future which will outlast time through VR and increases the render rate of the subjective experience.


I think the ultimate game is to actualize the mind of the god. Or in Schopenhauer's terms, reinforce the Will of the nature. Even the god is dying. God wants to [outlast the universe](https://youtu.be/5UxUS6bPiT8).
